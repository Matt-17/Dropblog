# Introduction to Dropblog

Welcome to Dropblog - a minimalist blogging platform that puts simplicity and performance at the forefront of content creation and sharing.

## üéØ Philosophy

Dropblog was created out of frustration with overly complex blogging platforms that prioritize features over usability. Our core philosophy is:

- **Monthly Archives**: Automatic organization by publication month
